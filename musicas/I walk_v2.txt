

I walk the shadows... of a sunless day.
The weight of the world... in a heavy gray.
No blood... no screams... just the endless strain.
Of dragging a body... that feels like a chain.
Feels like a chain!!

The mind is a maze with no open door.
Where the mist hides what I’m searching for.

It’s an unseen anchor dragging me down.
A silence that screams louder than this town.
Wandering the abyss, looking for a sign.
Just the echo of this solitude of mine.

The rain falls slowly... washing the ground.
Inside these walls... there is no sound.
It’s not the end... just a pause in the light.
A deep shade of grey... an endless night.

If I close my eyes, will the peace arrive?
It is just the dark keeping us alive!
The clock has stopped, the air is thin... We are losing the battle we tried to win!


The pain subsides at last... But the scars... will never go.

Never go...
