

The words are stuck inside my throat
A sinking ship... a broken boat
I try to scream, I try to cry
But all I do is watch the sky
The grey descends upon the room
I am the weaver... of my doom

No one hears the sound of breaking bone
When you are standing in the dark alone
The silence is a heavy stone
To crush the king upon his throne

The weight of silence drags me down
I wear the shadows like a crown
There is no light to lead me through
Just the memory... of you

The memory of you

The clock is ticking on the wall
Waiting for the hammer fall
I run through corridors of glass
Praying for the pain to pass... To pass

The weight of silence drags me down
I wear the shadows like a crown
There is no light to lead me through
Just the memory... of you

Ooooh... The quiet is so loud... Wrapped in a funeral shroud... I fade away... I fade away... Into the grey

The weight of silence drags me down
I wear the shadows like a crown
There is no light to lead me through
Just the memory... of you
Just the memory of you

Silence... Silence...
