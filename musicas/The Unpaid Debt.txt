

The morning light is razor sharp
It cuts the strings upon the harp
I wear the clothes that do not fit
A script was written, I realized it
I force a laugh to fill the room
But I am weaving on a broken loom

The pressure builds behind the eyes
A monuments of perfect lies
You ask for gold, I give you rust
A structure crumbling into dust

I cannot pay the debt I owe (The debt I owe...)
The seeds of failure that I sow
I try to stand, but gravity
Is pulling down
Is crushing me
I am the heavy earth beneath your feet

There is a wall of thickest glass
I watch the happy people pass
I scream your name, sound is dead
Static noise inside the head
I am a ghost within the machine
The saddest play you've ever seen

The circuit breaks, the signal dies
I cannot meet your demanding eyes
To be the son, to be the friend
I only break what I intend

I cannot pay the debt I owe (The debt I owe...)
The seeds of failure that I sow
I try to stand, but gravity
Is pulling down
Is crushing me
I am the heavy earth beneath your feet

I'm so tired... of trying to be... what I am not

I cannot pay the debt I owe (The debt I owe...)
The seeds of failure that I sow
I try to stand, but gravity
Is pulling down
Is crushing me
I am the heavy earth beneath your feet

Beneath your feet...
Crushing me...
