The soil... calls my name... beneath the frost.
A heavy blanket... for the battles lost.
I carry mountains... upon my chest.
A weary traveler... denied his rest.
Denied his rest!

The colors fade... to shades of grey.
The sun retreats... and runs away.
I am the winter... that never ends.
I am the silence... that descends.

This world is cold! (So cold...) 

My story is told!
I seek the earth, the roots, the deep! (Eternal sleep...)
Where no one wakes... and no one weeps!.

------

No blade is needed... to sever the tie.
Just the waiting... watching time die.
The clock is ticking... a hollow sound.
My shadow buries me... in the ground.

In the ground!

The pain is real... but the exit is near.
Let go of the hope... let go of the fear.

I close my eyes... and drift away!
To where the night... consumes the day!
Aaaahhhhhh! Consumes the day!

Dust... to dust.
Fade... to rust!
