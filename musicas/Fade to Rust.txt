

I count the cracks... upon the wall.
Waiting for... the sky to fall.
My bones are tired... of standing tall.
I hear the void... begin to call.
Begin to call!!

The heavy heart... can beat no more.
I leave my ghost... outside the door.
No wars to fight... no gods to fear.
The end of pain... is finally here.

Ahhhhh... Ahhhhh... Rest your head, oh weary soul.
The earth is warm, the night is whole.
Sleep now... Sleep now...
Let the silence take control...

The silence takes control!!!
I tear the veil... before my eyes!
To see the truth... behind the lies!
The ground opens up... to take me in!
To wash away... the stain of sin!

The heavy heart... can beat no more.
I leave my ghost... outside the door.
No wars to fight... no gods to fear.
The end of pain... is finally here.

I am dust (Dust to dust...)
I am rust (Fade to rust...)
