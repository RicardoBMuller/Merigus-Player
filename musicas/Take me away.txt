The sheets are cold, the room is grey.
I count the seconds... of another day.
Your scent is fading from the floor
I cannot do this... anymore
The mirror shows a ghost inside
Nowhere to run... nowhere to hide

If love is life, and you are gone
Then tell me why... must I go on?
The bottle whispers on the stand
The final ticket... in my hand

I cannot breathe without your air
The void is waiting everywhere
Take me away, I want to sleep
The dark promises are ours to keep
I’m walking towards the edge tonight
To kill the pain and end the fight

They say it’s wrong... they say it’s sin
But they don't feel the ice within
I see you waving from the shore
I’m coming home... forevermore

I cannot breathe without your air
The void is waiting everywhere
Take me away, I want to sleep
The dark promises are ours to keep
I’m walking towards the edge tonight
To kill the pain and end the fight

d the fight... I’m coming home.
