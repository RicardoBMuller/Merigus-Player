

The winter comes to claim the land
I hold the snowflakes in my hand
They melt away, just like my hope
I'm walking on... a burning rope
The fire is dead, the ash remains
Blood turns to ice inside my veins

There is no warmth inside this shell
I build my own frozen hell
The sun retreats, the shadows grow
Buried deep... beneath the snow

The cold is calling out my name
To bury sorrow and the shame
No more fire, no more pain
Just the sound of freezing rain... Freezing rain

Run from the light, embrace the chill
Time stands still upon the hill
Frozen heart, frozen eyes! Sever the bond, cut the ties... Cut the ties

The cold is calling out my name
To bury sorrow and the shame
No more fire, no more pain
Just the sound of freezing rain... Freezing rain

Ooooh... The ice is kind... It calms the mind... Sleep now... in the white... Endless... winter... night...

The cold is calling out my name
To bury sorrow and the shame
No more fire, no more pain
Just the sound of freezing rain... Freezing rain

So cold... So cold...
